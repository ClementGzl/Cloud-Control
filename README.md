# Cloud Control

The app that allows you to control and manage your AWS Instances easily and securely.

## Nothing is more secure than your face or your fingerprint

Biometric security is surely today's easiest and strongest way of accessing sensitive data with iOS. There is nothing to configure. Just launch the app and smile! (or put your finger on the TouchID sensor...). And if you're running on an older device, don't worry: you can enter your device's password instead.

## Your instances are now turned on quicker than ever

Tiered of having to write boring commands in order to turn on/off an instance? No problem. Simply trigger that switch, and it's done!

## Send reminders when your instances are still running

If you are using a free AWS account, you may want to be reminded to turn off an instance. There's a setting for that. You can choose the time interval between the instance launch time and the notification to be send.
